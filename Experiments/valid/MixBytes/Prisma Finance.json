            "description": "The issue with incorrect interest accrual could be addressed by expanding the check in the `_applyPendingRewards()` function. However, it's worth noting that the `defaultedDebt` pool can only be zeroed out if after a bad liquidation, the `_applyPendingRewards()` function is called for absolutely all troves in the system, which transfers the debt from `defaultedDebt` to the `totalActiveDebt` pool. This seems unfair to active accounts, who will have to pay for the debts of inactive users.",
