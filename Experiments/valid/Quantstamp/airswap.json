However, if the function is called a second time, the underlying `Indexer.setIntent` will only transfer a partial amount of the total transferred tokens (i.e., the delta of the previously set intent value versus the currently set intent value). Since the behavior of the `Delegate` and the `Indexer` differ in this regard, tokens can become stuck in the Delegate.",
