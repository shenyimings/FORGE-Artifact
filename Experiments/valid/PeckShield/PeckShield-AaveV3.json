            "description": "The Aave protocol's lending protocol has precision issues and uses SafeMath library to prevent overflow/underflow issues with uint256 operands, but since Solidity 0.8.0, checked arithmetic operations are included by default, making SafeMath unnecessary. However, there are still occasions that may introduce unexpected overflows/underflows in functions like isUsingAsCollateralOne() and reserveCache.reserveConfiguration.getDecimals()- ReserveConfiguration.DEBT_CEILING_DECIMALS.",
