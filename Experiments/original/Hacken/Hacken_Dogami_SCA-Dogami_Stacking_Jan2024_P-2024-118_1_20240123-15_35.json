Due to the lack of checks that limit their values, the reward ratio could be set to 0% or higher than 100%, leading to unwanted reward values.", "severity": "Low", "contract": "StakingLockPeriod, StakingFlex", "function": "constructor, setRewardRatio, _setStakingCondition", "lineNumber": "N/A"}, {"id": 1, "category": {"1": ["CWE-682"]}, "title": "Potential misuse of user funds in reward distribution due to incorrect constructor settings", "description": "In the current design of the project, a single token is utilized for both staking and distributing rewards. The rewards are allocated to users from a `rewardWallet`, which is specified in the `constructors` of two related contracts. However, there is a potential issue: if the `rewardWallet` is inadvertently set to the contract's own address `address(this)`, it could lead to the misappropriation of funds.", "severity": "Low", "contract": "StackingFlex.sol, StackingLockPeriod.sol", "function": "constructor", "lineNumber": "N/A"}]}
