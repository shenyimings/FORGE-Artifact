            "description": "A flash loan (and similarly a flash swap) is implemented using a pair of symmetric transactions: an opening transaction `flash_loan` that initiates the loan and transfers the loan amount to the user, and a closing transaction `verify_flash_loan` that checks that the loan has been properly closed. However, this check that ensures that the transactions use the same pool account was missing, effectively enabling taking a loan from a high-value pool and then repaying the loan to a low-value pool.",
