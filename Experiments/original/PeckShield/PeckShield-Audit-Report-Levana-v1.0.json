            "description": "In `Levana` protocol, cranking works by iterating through all price updates and performing operations for each price update point. One specific operation involves the checking of limit orders with a limit price that is reached by the cranking price. If a limit order is triggered, a new position will be opened at the current price. However, since the position is opened at the current price, there is a possibility of opening a position at an undesirable or worse price than the limit price.",
