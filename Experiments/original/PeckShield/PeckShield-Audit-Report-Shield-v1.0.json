When a new order is created, the private pool (`LP2`) is first checked for a possible match before evaluating with the public pool (`LP1`). Naturally, when there is a need to liquidate a private pool-matched order, the respective provider in `LP2` will be deducted for possible deficit, if any.", "severity": "Low", "contract": "DDSDAIPools2", "function": "close()", "lineNumber": "105-109"}]}
