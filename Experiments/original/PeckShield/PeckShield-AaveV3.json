However, there are still occasions that may introduce unexpected overflows/underflows in functions like isUsingAsCollateralOne() and reserveCache.reserveConfiguration.getDecimals()- ReserveConfiguration.DEBT_CEILING_DECIMALS.", "severity": "Low", "contract": "BorrowLogic, UserConfiguration", "function": "isUsingAsCollateralOne(), _getFirstAssetAsCollateralId()", "lineNumber": "121"}]}
