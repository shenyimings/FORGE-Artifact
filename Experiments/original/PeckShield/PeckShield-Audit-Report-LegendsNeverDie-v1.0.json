There are two kinds of rewards: weekly rewards and yearly rewards. Weekly rewards are rewards that can be claimed after each week while yearly rewards are rewards that can be claimed after the auction lobby is over. When reviewing the implementation of the MasterVault contract, we notice that the claimWeekly() function has a business logic error which could allow users to claim more rewards than they deserve.",
