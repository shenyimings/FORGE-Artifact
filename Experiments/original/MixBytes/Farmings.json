Later `AlgebraEternalFarming._getIncentiveByKey()` will revert for such incentives. So, it will be impossible to call `AlgebraEternalFarming.deactivateIncentive()`, `AlgebraEternalFarming.decreaseRewardsAmount()`, or `AlgebraEternalFarming.addRewards()`. So, the pool will be blocked from the creation of any incentive.", "severity": "High", "contract": "AlgebraEternalFarming", "function": "createEternalFarming()", "lineNumber": "L103"}, {"id": 1, "category": {"1": ["CWE-682"]}, "title": "A redundant call to `_updatePositionInVirtualPool` in the `_updatePosition` function", "description": "The call to `_updatePositionInVirtualPool` can be replaced with the `distributeRewards` call since the liquidityDelta argument is set to 0 at that point.", "severity": "Low", "contract": "AlgebraEternalFarming", "function": "_updatePosition", "lineNumber": "263"}, {"id": 2, "category": {"1": ["CWE-703"], "2": ["CWE-754"], "3": ["CWE-394"]}, "title": "Rebasable tokens cannot be used for rewards", "description": "The current farming design doesn't allow work with rebasable tokens.", "severity": "Low", "contract": "N/A", "function": "N/A", "lineNumber": "N/A"}]}
