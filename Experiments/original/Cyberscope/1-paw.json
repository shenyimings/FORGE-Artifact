However, the `usdc` token is considered a trusted source within the contract and no external address can be executed through the `withdraw()` method, making the usage of the `nonReentrant` modifier redundant.", "severity": "Low", "contract": "N/A", "function": "withdraw()", "lineNumber": "N/A"}, {"id": 1, "category": {"1": ["CWE-710"], "2": ["CWE-1120"]}, "title": "IDI - Immutable Declaration Improvement", "description": "The contract declares state variables that their value is initialized once in the constructor and are not modified afterwards.
