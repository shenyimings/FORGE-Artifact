The variable `swapThreshold` sets a threshold where the contract will trigger the swap functionality.

It is important to note that the price of the token representing it, can be highly volatile. This means that the value of a price volatility swap involving Ether could fluctuate significantly at the triggered point, potentially leading to significant price volatility for the parties involved.", "severity": "Minor / Informative", "contract": "TorWallet", "function": "N/A", "lineNumber": "519"}, {"id": 5, "category": {"1": ["CWE-710"], "2": ["CWE-1041"]}, "title": "RSML - Redundant SafeMath Library", "description": "The usage of the SafeMath library adds complexity, overhead and increases unnecessarily the gas consumption since Solidity versions greater than or equal to 0.8.0 have native functionality that replaces it.", "severity": "Minor / Informative", "contract": "TorWallet.sol", "function": "N/A", "lineNumber": "L20"}, {"id": 6, "category": {"1": ["CWE-664"], "2": ["CWE-665"], "3": ["CWE-909"], "4": ["CWE-456"]}, "title": "L02 - State Variables could be Declared Constant", "description": "State variables can be declared as constant using the constant keyword.
