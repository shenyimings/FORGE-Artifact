However, inside _setOwner(), the newOwner is directly stored in permissions back. It would be much safer if the transition is managed by implementing a two-step approach: _transferOwnership() and _updateOwnership().", "severity": "Low", "contract": "CrickDAO.sol", "function": "_setOwner()", "lineNumber": "452, 457"}]}
