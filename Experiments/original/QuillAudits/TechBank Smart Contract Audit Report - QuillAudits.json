            "description": "The protocol allows generated interest to be withdrawn only before the 7-day window elapses due to a check present in the if statement in the getInterest function. This puts the maximum interest rate to be ~7% just before the 7-day timer elapses, and the risk is interest gets locked forever after passing the 7-day mark.",
