When using the setMintCap function directly, an operator could front-run the transaction and completely spend the old cap and then spend the new one again after setting the transaction goes through.", "severity": "Minor", "contract": "Dram.sol", "function": "setMintCap()", "lineNumber": "L110-L115"}, {"id": 1, "category": {"1": ["CWE-284"], "2": ["CWE-269"], "3": ["CWE-266"]}, "title": "Centralized Contracts with Upgrade Capability", "description": "The Dram contracts are heavily centralized and can be upgraded, which might change their functions whenever necessary.
